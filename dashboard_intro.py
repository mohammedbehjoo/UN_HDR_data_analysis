# why
st.markdown("## :material/double_arrow: Why does it matter?")
st.write("The 2023/24 Human Development Report assesses the dangerous gridlock resulting\
    from uneven development progress, intensifying inequality, and escalating political polarization,\
        that we must urgently tackle. The report emphasizes how global interdependence is being reconfigured\
            and proposes a path forward where multilateralism plays a pivotal role.")
st.write("Why does pursuing the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement feel like a half-hearted slog through quicksand?\
    Why in many places does restoring peace, even pauses or ceasefires as hopeful preludes to peace, feel so elusive? \
        Why are we immobilized on digital governance while artificial intelligence races ahead in a data goldrush?\
        In short, why are we so stuck? And how do we get unstuck without resorting myopically to violence or isolationism? These questions motivate the Human Development Report.")
